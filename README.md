Muse-generated EEG Data Extraction and Preprocessing.

Project Description
------------------
The Muse headband captures 7 channels of EEG data to detect brain activity and provide real-time biofeedback. The goal of this project will be to create a utility application that will visualize and preprocess the raw data in preparation for further analyses (conduct standard and basic transformations, e.g. averaging over time and Fourier analysis).
