# Hackathon_2022
Muse-generated EEG Data Extraction and Preprocessing.

# Project Description
The Muse headband captures 7 channels of EEG data to detect brain activity and provide real-time biofeedback. The goal of this project will be to create a utility application that will visualize and preprocess the raw data in preparation for further analyses (conduct standard and basic transformations, e.g. averaging over time and Fourier analysis).

# SET-UP
```
* Having python XXX version is a requierment 
* You need to have a .csv file extracted from an EEG Muse session
* Clone the repository into your integrated development environment
* ?
```

# running the analysis
```
* The easiest way of running the analysis is using the **main.py** file
```
